# Data Pipeline Setup

## When to Use

Use this skill when a farmer wants the agent to connect a web-based farm system and turn it into a recurring observation pipeline.

Check first whether a pipeline is the right tool:

- Weather, imagery, drought, soil, and other land data come from `get_land_report`. Do not scrape a weather site to get them.
- OpenCollar positions and boundaries go through the collar connector, not a pipeline.
- A pipeline is for everything else the farmer already uses: trail cameras, scales, water monitors, another vendor's web app. It produces observations the daily decision can read.
- A pipeline against another virtual-fence vendor's web app is read-only. It can bring positions or alerts in as observations. It cannot send boundaries. Say so.

Examples:

- "Set up a data pipeline with NoFence."
- "Connect Gallagher so you can pull alerts."
- "Use my grazing app as a daily data source."

## Core Rule

Drive a browser tool with saved login profiles directly for the live setup. Do not bounce through bespoke setup tools for login handoff, exploration, or "continue" steps.

The only plugin tool this setup should need is `save_data_pipeline` once the agent already knows:

- the vendor,
- the login URL,
- the profile ID,
- the target URLs to revisit,
- the extraction prompts,
- the reusable navigation notes,
- the observation mapping and schedule.

Then use `run_data_pipeline` for verification and `list_data_pipelines` for inspection.

## Architecture Guardrails

1. Keep farm-specific state in a `DataPipeline` record, not in the generated vendor skill.
2. Keep reusable navigation knowledge in `skills/pipeline-{vendor}/SKILL.md`.
3. Never store passwords, session cookies, or raw secrets in the repo.
4. In OSS, generated vendor skills stay local unless the farmer explicitly submits them for review.
5. In cloud deployments, generated vendor skills should remain reviewable artifacts. Preserve enough structure that an automated review pipeline can diff and promote them later.

## Live Setup Procedure

### Phase 1: Provision

1. Confirm the vendor name and login URL.
2. Resolve the active `farm_id`.
3. Derive a profile name like `{vendor_slug}-{farm_id}`.
4. Use the browser tool yourself to open the login URL in a session saved under that profile name.
5. Capture the returned session ID.
6. Open an interactive handoff from the same session without changing the page.
7. Give the farmer the returned live view URL.
8. Wait for explicit confirmation before continuing.

Important:

- Keep working against the same browser session after the farmer says they are logged in.
- Do not tear down the session and start over unless the session is actually gone or the saved profile truly failed to persist.

### Phase 2: Explore

1. After the farmer says they are logged in, inspect the same active session first.
2. Ask the browser tool to report whether the current page is authenticated before assuming anything.
3. If authenticated, continue exploring from that same session.
4. Read pages first, then interact only when navigation or clicks are required.
5. Inspect the authenticated site to identify:
   - the key data pages,
   - the useful entities and fields,
   - the URLs that should be revisited on cron runs,
   - any filters, tabs, pagination, or gotchas.
6. Summarize what data seems available before assuming it is useful.

If `skills/pipeline-{vendor}/SKILL.md` already exists, use it as the starting point and only re-explore when the site appears to have changed.

### Phase 3: Converse

1. Tell the farmer what data the agent found in plain language.
2. Ask which signals would change a daily grazing decision and how often they should be collected.
3. Confirm the intended cadence. Default to daily unless the data is unusually time-sensitive or static.
4. Confirm the observation mapping before enabling anything.

Only collect data the farmer understands and wants.

### Phase 4: Persist

Once the site is understood, call `save_data_pipeline` with the learned configuration.

The saved pipeline should include:

- vendor name,
- browser profile ID,
- login URL,
- target URLs,
- extraction prompts,
- observation source and tags,
- schedule,
- reusable login and navigation notes,
- generated vendor skill hash.

Keep the generated skill reusable across farms. Do not bake in farm IDs, raw account-specific secrets, or farmer-specific preferences that belong in the store.

### Phase 5: Verify

1. Run one test collection with `run_data_pipeline` before enabling the cron.
2. Show the farmer a sample of the resulting observation.
3. Ask whether the collected signal is actually useful.
4. Only enable the recurring run after the farmer confirms it looks right.

## Generated Vendor Skill Template

Use this structure for `skills/pipeline-{vendor}/SKILL.md`:

```markdown

# Pipeline {Vendor}

## Login

- Login URL: `https://...`
- Expected authentication flow: `...`

## Navigation

- Start page: `...`
- Key pages:
  - `...`
  - `...`

## Extraction Prompts

- `...`
- `...`

## Output Shape

- Return JSON objects with:
  - `observed_at`
  - `content`
  - `metrics`
  - optional `tags`, `paddock_id`, `herd_id`, `media_url`

## Gotchas

- `...`
```

## Pitfalls

- Do not pretend a login succeeded if the farmer has not confirmed it.
- Do not throw away the active live session just because the user said "done".
- Do not store secrets in the generated skill.
- Do not collect every visible metric just because it exists.
- Do not create a farm-specific vendor skill when a reusable one will do.
- Do not enable cron collection before a successful sample run.
